Main Documents
1. sky_pixel_identification.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main document for the sky pixel identification application. It contains the source code along with detailed explanations and comments for each step of the process. The notebook contains all the necessary Python scripts and modules required for the sky pixel identification application. These scripts include the core functionality for image processing, pixel classification, and visualization.

2. dataset
The dataset directory contains a dataset of 20 images with sky scenes. These images are used for testing and validation purposes during the development of the application. Users can also utilize these images to evaluate the performance of the sky pixel identification algorithm.

3. requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file lists all the required Python packages and their versions needed to run the sky pixel identification application. Users can install these packages using pip to ensure compatibility and proper functioning of the application.

Usage
